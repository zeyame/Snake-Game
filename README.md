# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical interface. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the boundaries of the screen.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** The snake moves in the direction specified by the player (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Apple Generation:** Apples appear randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the number of apples eaten.
- **Game Over:** Displays the final score and a "Game Over" message when the snake collides with itself or the screen edge.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction.
- Eat apples (red squares) to grow longer.
- Avoid running into walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides, and the final score is displayed.
